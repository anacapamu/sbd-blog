**Overview:** Talking about mental health and learning how to approach negative emotions are difficult topics, but practicing and discussing mindfulness may help. Here are two guided meditation resources that I combined to share with my students.

**Materials:**

Weekly handouts, speakers

**Resources:**

- [Headspace App (free for educators)](https://www.headspace.com/educators)

- [Mindful Choices](/downloads/middlehighmcguide1.pdf)

- [Why I'm into meditation | Bill Gates](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Headspace-Guide-to-Meditation-and-Mindfulness)

- [Kobe on sleep and meditation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdrVVJPlUK4)

**Suggested Pacing: (10-15 minutes, weekly)**

Week 1 - Headspace Basics 1 | Mindful Choices Mini-Lesson 1

Week 2 - Headspace Basics 2 | Mindful Choices Mini-Lesson 2

Week 3 - Headspace Basics 3 | Mindful Choices Mini-Lesson 3

...and so on.

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Week 1** - My main goal with the first few lessons is to get buy-in. I give a basic explanation of what mindfulness is and share examples of famous people who have voiced their support for it (e.g. Bill Gates, Kobe, etc.). The first mini-lesson goes over its benefits as well. This sets the rationale for why students should care.

I typically listen to the Headspace session prior to sharing it with them, so I can give students an idea of what to focus on when we start. The Mindful Choices Mini-Lesson is assigned for homework.

**Week 2 Onward** - Depending on the upcoming Headspace session and Mindful Choices mini-lesson, I may supplement or omit portions. Before each session, I remind them to focus on what they want to improve on and how to have good posture, etc. For students who get distracted, a gentle reminder generally gets them to refocus.
