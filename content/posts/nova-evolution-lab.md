**Overview:** This is a neat, guided online simulation that explores evolution through the lens of phylogeny. It follows a naturally engaging format, with questions such as "Is an animal or a plant more closely related to a fungus?" (students generally think plant, leading to the question of "what? how?")

Overall, the simulation works great as an introductory or review resource for phylogeny/evolution. However, it is a bit lengthy and repetitive, so I don't recommend doing all the missions.

**Materials:**

Worksheets, online access

**Resources:**

**Suggested Pacing: (3-5 days)**

Day 1 - introduce what phylogeny is | show how to navigate the website

Days 2-5 - you can do about 1-2 missions per day

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - As always, I recommend that you explore the simulation yourself before showing it to the class. There are some short videos that explain how to navigate the features on the simulation, but I think it's easier to show them one.

For the first day, I like using some of the questions in the simulation as their warmups (e.g. Is a mushroom more closely related to a gecko or a palm tree? Explain). This tends to prompt good discussion and I don't actually share the answer until we jump into the simulation.

As they're logging on, I tell them to sign in with the school email. This is important to save their progress if you want to do more than one mission. Before they begin, I share the introduction video with the class and we do the first two steps of Mission 1 as a class. I show them how to create a phylogenetic tree, place the traits, and use the hints. Students use the remaining time to work on the missions themselves.

**Days 2-5** - As they work on the missions and answer the questions with their partners, I try checking in with them if they aren't sure how to do it. Depending on your students, the missions can take about 15-25 minutes each.

I typically only do the first 2-4 missions, depending on what pieces of evidence I want to learn/review. I do a partial review at the end to clarify any questions they may have.
