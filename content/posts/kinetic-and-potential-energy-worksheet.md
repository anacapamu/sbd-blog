**Overview:** Here's a worksheet that can be used to supplement the [paper roller coaster project](/posts/the-paper-roller-coaster-project) and energy unit. It can be used after introducing the concepts and formulas for kinetic and potential energy.

**Materials:**

Handouts

**Resources:**

- [Kinetic and Potential Energy Worksheet](/downloads/kinetic-and-potential-energy-worksheet.pdf)

- [Kinetic and Potential Energy Answer Key](/downloads/kinetic-and-potential-energy-answer-key.docx)

**Suggested Pacing: (2 days)**

Day 1 - introduce and model questions

Day 2 - review some questions as a class

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - This can be used as a homework assignment or be done in class individually/in pairs. I've introduced this while doing the paper roller coaster project, as it has examples related to what they're working on.

**Day 2** - I typically use the project groups to divvy up the review. I select the questions to review and I have students write their answers and work on the board, before we review it as a class. The answer key can be projected on screen while students peer-grade the work.

**Credits:** Worksheet and image creators unknown.
