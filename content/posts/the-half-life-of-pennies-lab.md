**Overview:** This is a simple lab to demonstrate how half-lives work. Students use 100 pennies to represent the decay of Carbon-14. After each half-life, roughly half the pennies should "decay."

**Materials:**

100 pennies, Ziploc bags

**Resources:**

- [Half-life of Pennies Lab](/downloads/half-life-of-pennies-lab.pdf)

- [SciShow - How to Date Dead Things](https://youtu.be/fx3BqQ44zDE)

**Suggested Pacing: (~1-2 days)**

Day 1 - introduce and work on lab

Day 2 - review graph and questions

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - After splitting students up into groups of 4, I go over the instructions with the class. I ask them to write down "heads" next to the "number of coins removed" and "tails" next to the "number of coins remaining."

Each group will be given a bag with 100 pennies to represent Carbon-14 or any radioactive element. Each round, students shake the pennies and count the amount of "heads" and "tails" to record in their data tables. Once they finish, they may create a graph and answer the rest of the questions.

**Day 2** - After the students finish working on the lab and answering the questions, I review the answers on the board. Each group is randomly assigned a question and we go over it together. I have them peer grade it, as a way to see what they missed, but I typically give them credit based on completion.

At the end, I share this [video on how to date dead things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx3BqQ44zDE&t=1s) and clarify any other questions they may have.

**Credits:** My colleagues for sharing this resource.
