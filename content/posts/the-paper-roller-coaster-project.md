**Overview:** As part of my physics unit, I've used the Paper Roller Coaster project as a wonderfully engaging engineering project that explores Newton's three laws of motion, gravity, friction, kinetic energy, potential energy, etc. After learning about forces and energy, students have a chance to be creative and collaboratively build their own unique roller coasters, while applying the new concepts that they learn. I also found that this project works extremely well if you do the [marshmallow towers](/posts/marshmallow-towers/) the day before starting this one.

On a side note, this is a popular, but pricey project to do, as card stock and tape can run up $200-300 for around 150 students. However, leftover supplies can be used the following year, which may reduce future costs. I would suggest using department funds or doing a fundraiser for the material purchases.

**Materials:**

Estimated supplies for about 150 students with semi-clear instructions to conserve paper and tape:

- Packs of 250 8x11.5” card stock by color

  - 6-8 packs of white cardstock

  - 2 of every other color

- 10 or more scissors (at least 1 per group, but ideally enough for 1 per student)

- 30 rolls of tape w/ at least 1 dispenser per group

**Resources:**

Templates and instructions for building can be found on [paperrollercoaster.com](http://paperrollercoaster.com) or for free on YouTube/online:

**Suggested Pacing: (~12-15 days)**

Day 1 – introduce paper roller coaster project and go over the requirements/grading

- HW: Each group member builds 3 supporting pieces at home

- For each group, have: 1 bag for roller coaster pieces, 1 marble for future testing, 1 cardboard/foam board base by Day 3

Day 2 – notes on potential and kinetic energy | model how to build supports (columns and beams) | outline plan for roller coaster

- HW: Build 3 more supporting pieces at home

Day 3 – outline plan for roller coaster | model how to build tracks | show examples of frameworks

- HW: Flow of Energy Worksheets

Day 4 – peer review KE + PE HW | build pieces for framework and tracks

Day 5 – more KE + PE practice work | build day

Day 6 – build and assemble pieces | goal = 20% completion

Day 7 – build and assemble pieces | goal = 35% completion

Day 8 – build and assemble pieces | goal = 50% completion

Day 9 – build and assemble pieces | goal = 65% completion

Day 10 – build and assemble pieces | goal = 80% completion

Day 11 – build and assemble pieces | goal = 100% completion | final testing | aesthetic improvements

Day 12 – rollercoaster test day 1 | work on KE + PE rollercoaster calculations

Day 13 – rollercoaster test day 2 | work on KE + PE rollercoaster calculations

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - After front-loading the basics of forces and energy, I introduce this engineering project as a group challenge to build a unique, gravity-based paper roller coaster. I let them know that the basic premise is simple and the requirements serve as a checklist for what to do, but they have a lot of freedom to be creative. More about grading below.

Aside from going over the requirements, I try to maximize productivity in class by showing them how to fold columns and beams and assigning them HW to make 3 on their own by the next day. I also show them a [video on what their roller coasters could feature.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7eZmHyOTK0)

**Days 2-4** - For materials, I suggest that groups split the cost for buying a foam board and the person who goes to buy it doesn't pay. A normal paper grocery bag works and is easy to write the names on them. I'm not too particular about the marble size, and I generally have a few in class for them to use.

As for parts, I focus on showing them how to build the framework first, before gradually introducing the tracks. I'd recommend having pre-built pieces to show what the sizes might look like. This will also help them plan their roller coasters.

**Days 5-13** - For the rest of the days, I intersperse videos and notes on kinetic and potential energy. I try to keep those under 15 minutes and I give them the rest of the time to build. I roam around the room and help them if they have any questions or if they're struggling with building a part. I also give suggested progress goals to encourage them to stay on top of their work.

**Classroom Preparation:**

- Have an area for all the roller coaster parts and labels for them

- If possible, partition off areas for each period to place their projects/foam boards/bags

- Be clear about cleanliness and allow for about 5 minutes for clean up before the period ends

**Grading:**

Because of the length of the project and the amount of effort that goes into it, I don't want any students to score below a C. Thus, the grading is curved for each period. I remove any outliers to try to push everyone towards a B or higher, as one of my main goals is for them to be okay with taking risks; that can occasionally lead to spectacular failures.

Roller coaster grading – (highest group score – lowest group score) / 25 ; score range between 75% - 100%
