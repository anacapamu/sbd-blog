When I first began teaching, it was a constant struggle to plan, find, and develop fun and engaging science lessons that would make learning enjoyable for all of my students. I generally found it incredibly helpful when my colleagues or other science teachers were willing to share their pacing guides and lessons, so I wanted to extend the same courtesy to all of my fellow science educators. From phenomenon-driven lessons to hands-on labs and mini-projects, Science Breakdowns is my ongoing collection of science resources that Iâ€™ve created, adapted, or used within my own classroom.

A big thank you to all of my colleagues throughout the years who have generously shared their wealth of knowledge and lesson plans with me. This site would not have been existed without your help.
