## Overview

This is a simple activity that can help students better understand how eclipses occur. The materials are the same from the Reasons for the Seasons Lab, but the focus is on how the students are angled when rotating the "moon" and how that may affect our perspective of the moon from Earth.

## Materials

– Light bulbs, either with a clamp or as part of a lamp (to represent the sun)

– Foam balls (to represent the Earth and moon)

– Pencil/stick (for Earth’s axis)

– Lunar Phases Station Lab Student Worksheets

### Preparation

– Depending on the number of groups, set up lamps/light bulb stands and foam ball throughout the classroom (1 light source and 2 foam balls for each group)

## Pacing

### Suggested Pacing

Day 1 - model activity | prior to lunar phases and eclipses station labs

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes

**Day 1** - Because we have done a similar activity before, the purpose of revisiting this simulation is to emphasize the smaller changes in lighting on our "moon" (foam ball). The first rotation should be done at a 45 degree angle (up or down is ok), and the second rotation should be done with the "moon" directly aligned with student's head (to simulate an eclipse instead of a full moon).

It is useful to model the two rotations to the students and let them know what to focus on. Students may then work in pairs or small groups to observe and record what they see on their Lunar Phases worksheets.
