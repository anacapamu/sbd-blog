## Overview

A Harry Potter-inspired resource for introducing genetic inheritance if you *wand* to give it a try. Overall, it's well-organized and informative, but the original lessons were a bit lengthy, so I included an abridged version for Lessons 1 & 2.

## Materials

Handouts, project, whiteboard

## Pacing

### Suggested Pacing

Day 1 - pre-lesson | lesson 1

Day 2 - lesson 2 | review questions

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes

**Days 1 & 2** - The teacher notes in the resources can give you a good idea on how to implement the lessons. I personally preferred having shorter versions that allowed for students to work together and figure them out, but they are adjustable depending on where your students are at.
