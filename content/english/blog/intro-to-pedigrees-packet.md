## Overview

This was a resource I've used for high school biology and summer school. It has integrated explanations throughout the packet and can also work as a standalone self-review packet for students. Since it can be lengthy, I would do several examples with the students, before reviewing them together as a class. Depending on the time, you may also omit problems and still achieve the same result.

## Pacing

### Suggested Pacing

Day 1 - introduce and model pedigrees | work on packet

Day 2 - clarify questions | work on packet | share answers on the board and review as a class

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - Depending on the level of your students, you may decide how much you want to walk them through. I prefer to ask students down a row to answer each question, so that they can take an active role and demonstrate what they understand.

As they work on the packets, I generally let them work with their partners. I try to check in with every group to see if they understand how pedigrees work.

**Day 2** - On the second day, I can go over more sample pedigrees if needed. When they finish, they can share their answers on a few pedigrees I've selected on the board. I let them go up with their groups and we can peer grade them when I project the answers on the screen.

**Credits:** Unknown creator for the packet. The answer key was also shared by someone else online and is not the exact same worksheet as the one posted.
