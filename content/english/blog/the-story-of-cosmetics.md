**Overview:** Here is an example of human impact on Earth and ourselves, looking specifically at how cosmetics are made and what is in them. My students tend to enjoy it because it's relevant to what they personally use in their daily lives. The student worksheet provided is scaffolded for ESL students.

**Materials:**

Handouts, projector, dictionaries (optional)

**Resources:**

- [The Story of Cosmetics Video](https://www.storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-cosmetics/)

- [Story of Cosmetics Worksheet w/ Answer Key](/downloads/story-of-cosmetics-worksheet.pdf)

- [EWG Skin Deep](https://www.ewg.org/skindeep/)

**Suggested Pacing: (1 day)**

Day 1 - introduce & show video | discussion questions

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - To introduce the video, I typically start with a warmup question asking what cosmetic products they use (e.g. makeup, gel, shampoo, etc.). Then, I use our discussion as a springboard to look deeper at how a product is made and the impact it may have on the environment and on our lives.

Before the video, I give a few minutes for students to use dictionaries, work together, and write down definitions. We briefly review the vocabulary before moving on. When showing the video, I pause it at certain points to give students time to write down their answers. I also ask them to write down questions for discussion if they have any.

Once the video is over, they can finish writing down their answers and share it with a partner. In those partner pairs, we discuss the questions as a class.
