**Overview:** In our unit on human impact, we discuss what biomimicry is and how it can be used to create more sustainable and efficient technology. The project allows students to design their own nature-inspired technology and present their ideas to their peers.

**Materials:**

- Internet access

- Student worksheets & rubric

**Resources:**
- [Biomimicry Research Project | Original Guide](/downloads/biomimicry-project.pdf)

- [Biomimicry Research Project Instructions w/ Rubric | Student Worksheet](/downloads/biomimicry-research-project-instructions.docx)

**Suggested Pacing: (5-6 days)**

Day 1 - Introduce project | Work in groups to define & research problems

Days 2-4 - Research solutions & work on designs

Days 5-6 - Present final designs

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - For their warmups, I ask students to share some of their ideas about what biomimicry is and if they know of any inventions inspired by nature. After we discuss the warmups, I show them a [video on what biomimicry is and how it has improved technology](https://youtu.be/iMtXqTmfta0). Before we go over the project, I have students get into groups of 3-4. Groups may be random or student-selected. I project the worksheet on screen and we go over the directions as a class. Depending on how much time is left, I let them brainstorm about problems they want to research.

**Days 2-4** - For their warmups, I ask students to share some of their ideas about what the problem they want to solve. The goal of our discussions is to help guide their research and ideas. After the warmups, students have a chance to work in their groups and research plausible solutions to the problem they want to solve.

As for the final designs, students may create a poster and/or presentation to describe their nature-inspired solutions. They may also create a 3-D model of their designs if they have time. On Day 4, I put out a presentation sign up sheet for groups to sign up for when they would like to present. I typically give a few extra points for groups willing to go first.

**Days 5-6** - Students share their biomimicry projects to the class (see rubric for scoring). As groups are presenting, I have the other students take notes on what each project was about. When everyone is done presenting, we do a short debrief on the ideas that they liked best and how they could improve their future designs.
