## Overview

As part of the forces and motion unit, we review different types of friction and how they're applied in real-world contexts. This Bill Nye video goes over a few examples and can be used to introduce or review the concept. The accompanying video questions can be shared digitally, used for classroom discussions, and/or as an emergency sub plan.

## Pacing

### Suggested Pacing

Days 1-2 - watch the video and take notes | review questions

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes

**Day 1** - For our warmups, I ask my students what they know about friction and if they think there is friction in space (without sharing the answer). After a brief discussion, I introduce the video and I let them know that the warmup questions will be covered in the video. For the video notes, the questions are in chronological order and I don't require students to write full sentences.

After the video is over, I give them some time to discuss with their peers and we can review it as a class before turning it in.
