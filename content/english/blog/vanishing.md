## Overview

When discussing climate change, sustainability, and the impacts of human activities on our environment, one notable area to highlight is the alarming rate of extinctions on our planet and what has caused it.

This CNN video special looks at five areas affected by climate change and here are my video notes for students to answer and use for class discussions. It can also be used as an emergency sub plan or for online learning.

## Pacing

### Suggested Pacing

Day 1 - warmup on # of extinctions | watch video | review & discuss

Day 2 - wrap up discussion if necessary

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes

**Day 1** - I start this lesson with a warmup asking students to guess how many mass extinctions we've had in Earth's history. After we discuss it, I like to show a [4-minute ASAP Science video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wissIOikrqc) on the five mass extinctions we've had and the sixth that may be currently occurring.

With the video as context, I explain that extinctions occur naturally, but our planet is currently experiencing it at an abnormally high rate. This transitions into the CNN video for students to see how and why these extinctions are occurring. After students are done watching, we review the questions as a class and I share a closer look at why birds eat plastic, specifically through a resource on [the Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/) to show how it may affect marine life and humans directly.
