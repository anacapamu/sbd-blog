## Overview

After learning about natural selection, students can test their knowledge on what qualifies as natural selection with seven different examples.

## Materials

Handouts

## Resources

- [Is it Natural Selection](/downloads/is-it-natural-selection.pdf)

- [Is it Natural Selection Key](/downwloads/is-it-natural-selection-key.pdf)

- [Natural Selection Checklist](/downloads/natural-selection-checklist.pdf)

## Pacing

### Suggested Pacing: (1-2 days)

Day 1 - introduce and work on scenarios

Day 2 - review and discuss

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes

**Day 1-2** - This could be done in small groups or pairs. I like to give students an opportunity to do more than one, so I assign one example per group and let them choose another scenario to practice. The checklist can help guide their discussions.

After they finish, we review and discuss scenarios as a class. Depending on where you think your students are at, this may require more time to review.
