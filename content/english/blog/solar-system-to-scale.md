## Overview

A NASA-inspired variation of the receipt paper solar system, this version includes a little more math.

## Materials

3-4 rolls of receipt paper, color pencils and/or markers, meter sticks, calculators

## Resources

- [Astronomy to Scale Group Project](/downloads/solar-system-to-scale-group-project.pdf)

- [Cosmic Eye Video](https://youtu.be/8Are9dDbW24)

- [To Scale: The Solar System Video](https://youtu.be/zR3Igc3Rhfg)

## Pacing

### Suggested Pacing

Day 1 - introduce project | model calculations

Day 2 - calculations and drawings

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes

**Day 1** - Understanding the space between planets is hard. I try to get them to think about abstract units by giving them a warmup on Earth relative to the Sun and showing them the [Cosmic Eye Video](https://youtu.be/8Are9dDbW24) afterwards. I let them know that the project we'll be working on will help them visualize our solar system.

After grouping students in 3-4, I go over the instructions with them and we do the first two together. This is also a good time to define vocabulary such as AU or light years, before letting them start their calculations. I ask that while they only need to turn in one page of work, I want all of them to be working on it individually before coming together as a group.

To clean up, I suggest that they fold it in half until it's more compact and I give them a paperclip to hold it together. After asking them to make sure their names and periods are on it, I give them a place to put their projects by periods.

**Day 2** - Mostly a student work day. I use it to roam around and make sure that they understand how to do calculations and I show them again if necessary. If they finish their calculations, they can begin drawing on their receipt paper.

After they finish, I show them the [To Scale: The Solar System Video](https://youtu.be/zR3Igc3Rhfg) and [If the Moon Was Only 1 Pixel](https://joshworth.com/dev/pixelspace/pixelspace_solarsystem.html) to highlight how vast our solar system is.
