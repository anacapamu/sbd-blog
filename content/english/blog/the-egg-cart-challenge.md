**Overview:** After introducing Newton's laws of motion, I use this challenge as a fun and engaging lab to apply some of the concepts they've learned.

**Materials:**

Projector, student worksheets

Materials for building the egg carts:
- Popsicle sticks, rubber bands, straws, balloons, string, washers, tape, paper, scissors

Materials for testing the egg carts:

- Eggs (1 per group of 4)

- Sandwich bags (to reuse uncracked eggs and keep them from making a mess)

- Plastic eggs (for practice trials)

- Ramp (can use a foam board or anything else flat)

Less Mess Option: An average egg weighs around 60 grams. You can replicate this by filling plastic eggs with cotton + washers/pennies/screw nuts/etc.

**Suggested Pacing: (3 days)**

Day 1 - introduce challenge | brainstorm ideas in groups

Day 2 - build and test designs

Day 3 - test day | discussion questions (if time allows)

**Pacing w/ Teacher Notes:**

**Day 1** - For their warmups, I ask students to list and explain different factors to consider in car accidents. After we discuss the warmups, I have students get into groups of 3-4. Groups may be random or student-selected. I project the worksheet on screen and I have students read the directions. As they're reading each part, I show them the materials they can use and I ask them to think about how each material could be useful in protecting an egg in a collision. Note: I let them know that their budget is based on imaginary dollars, but you may still find out which students don't pay attention when they ask if they need to bring money the next day.

For the second half of class, they may start brainstorming ideas and getting materials for their cart. I usually section out a bookshelf for them to place their unfinished carts.

**Day 2** - For their warmups, I ask students to choose a few of the materials and explain why those items may be useful in their egg cart designs (weight, cushioning, etc.). After reviewing the items, I let them know that they may borrow a plastic egg (with washers) when they're ready to test their designs. They should spend most of the class prototyping and improving on their egg carts and I check in with each group to make sure they're making progress.

**Day 3** - On the test day, I give students the first ten minutes to finish making final adjustments. I also make a list for students to sign up to go first, and I offer 1 extra credit point for the first few groups that volunteer.

For the actual tests, I wrap the eggs in a sandwich bag (airtight) and I let the students load it into their own carts. During the test, they release their carts from the top of the ramp and I inspect the egg after the collision. When a group finishes, they may work on the questions and clean up any of the materials they used.
