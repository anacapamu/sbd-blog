## Overview

Pigeonetics is an interactive and fun way to explore and visualize how genetics works. Students can try to solve 26 mini pigeon-breeding puzzles that explain key concepts of  Mendelian inheritance.

### Suggested Pacing

Day 1 – intro to Pigeonetics + student exploration

### Pacing w/ Teacher Notes

**Day 1** - During our genetics unit, I’ve used Pigeonetics as a fun way to introduce Punnett squares. Alternatively, it can also be an ungraded review/challenge game for students to do if they finish assignments early.

If using Piegeonetics as an introductory game: I introduce the topic with warmup questions, such as “What do you think traits are?” and “Why do you think babies look like their parents?” After a brief discussion, we transition into exploring Pigeonetics. Students can play this game by themselves or with a partner.

After about 20 minutes, we review patterns we noticed as a class and write some of them on the board. If we use the worksheet, we review some of the answers together before starting the unit.
